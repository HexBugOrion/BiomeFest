# Biome Fest
An ambitious biome mod built on [**Biolith**](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/Biolith), a Fabric-based biome API.

Why Biolith? Unfortunately the existing biome library, TerraBlender, is poorly made, and even more poorly documented. They also enforce the need to use Mojmap, which is hard to read (in my opinion).

## Goals

Biome Fest aims to re-create the feel, looks, and atmosphere of older biome mods like 1.7-1.12 Biome O' Plenty, among other things.

## Current biome list:

**Oak Woodlands**</br>This temperate biome is almost exclusively populated by oak trees.

**Sub-boreal Forest**</br>This cool biome is populated by a mix of oak, spruce, and birch trees.

**Pine Forest**</br>A cool biome populated mostly by Pine trees, littered with patches of spruces.

## License

This mod is licensed under GNU-LGPLv3.0, and will stay that way.

There is one more addition however. Do not, I repeat NOT, port this mod to Forge under ANY circumstances.
